        <p>Crucial to the ongoing philosophical and legal debates about the tradeoffs between our physical security and data privacy 
is a thorough understanding of current technical capabilities; spanning from that which is thoroughly ingrained in our 
societies to the bleeding edge of research. This may very well be one of the most important discussions of our time.
Taking, of course, a backseat to climate change, which we are often guilty of understanding just as poorly.</p>

<p>Determining what data governments and corporations can have access to is no simple feat.
On the one hand, quick access to the right messages at the right time can save hundreds of lives from terrorist attacks,
can help catch a variety of criminals, save hostages, and generally help our security agencies keep us safe.
Allowing corporations access to our messages, images, contacts, and (essentially) life, gives us free perks beyond 
previous generationsâ€™ wildest imaginations.
On the other hand, the governments that we trust at this very moment and the corporations that we are all too willing to 
provide data to may or may not merit the same levels of trust in 10, 20, or 50 years. Some data will likely be stored over generations.
Not to mention that these very organizations often get hacked - revealing our information to unknown malicious agents.</p>

<p>The intent of this blog is not to argue for one side or the other of the debate. I will try to be as impartial as possible
while laying down the technological facts, spaning from the present-day capabilities of artificial intelligence to those of cryptography
and other privacy-preserving methods.</p>
